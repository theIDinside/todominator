# todominator README

Simple extension that keeps a record / tracks todo()'s, bug()'s, fixme()'s and feature_request()'s in the source code.

For now, it just parses the file in a rudimentary way. But tests seem to suggest it works.

The backend is functional, now it only needs to be displayed somehow.
